Android is an open source and Linux-based
Operating System for mobile devices
such as smartphones
and tablet computers.
Android was developed by the Open Handset Alliance,
led by Google,, and other companies.
Android offers a unified approach 
to application development 
 for mobile devices
which means developers 
 need only develop for Android,
and their applications
 should be able to run on
 different devices
powered by Android.
The first beta version
 of the Android Software
Development Kit (SDK) 
was released by 
Google in 2007
where as the first commercial version,
Android 1.0,
 was released in September 2008.
